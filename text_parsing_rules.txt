This is a documenation about how text should is parsed in order to fit BERT model.

#0 TEXT_STRUCTURE

    - Spearation by whitespace
        1. Each text chunk must start and end with additional whitespace
        2. Each word must be separeted by whitespace

#1 NUMBERS

#3 URLS
    All urls should be replaced with special token [URL]

#4 UNICODE
    1. Emojis
    
    2. Emoticons

    3. Replacable for ASCII

        All other unicodes just remove or replace with token [WRD]

    4. Words from antoher languages
